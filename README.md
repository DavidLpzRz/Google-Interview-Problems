# 🧠 Google Interview Problems – Algorithm Practice

This repository contains **my own implementations** of two classic **technical interview problems commonly used by Google** and other top technology companies.

Both exercises focus on **algorithmic efficiency, problem-solving, and optimal decision-making**.

## 📚 Problems Included

1. **Trapping Rain Water**
2. **Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock**

Each problem is implemented independently and optimized for interview-style solutions.
